I tried many apps and ways to get organised. Nothing worked â€“ at least until I decided to strip everything to bare bones: cash and weekly budgets.\footnote{Test}

\section{Getting started}

The good news is that all you need is pen and paper, 3 envelopes and some index cards.

\subsection{The three envelopes}

\subsubsection{\color{CurrentWeek} Current week}

This envelope is for the current week. Whatever is in it, you are free to use for anything, but once it runs out, the party's over.

\subsubsection{\color{Savings} Savings}

Anything that doesn't get used in a week goes into the savings.

\begin{note}
  There's more to savings, but let's keep it simple for now.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{\color{ComingWeeks} Coming weeks}

Since we're on cash-only system, it's important to have cash available. That's what the coming weeks envelope is for.

\subsection{Index cards}

\indexcard{assets/card-1}
\indexcard{assets/card-2}

\subsection{Weekly review}

Once a week in a predetermined time (Sunday evening?) one has to sit down, close the current week and open a new one.
