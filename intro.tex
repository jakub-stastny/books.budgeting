\section*{Introduction}

Doesn't matter how much you make if your back pocket has a hole in it.

\enquote{Be a good treasurer}, my grandfather used to advise me.

I saw the matter differently \enquote{Why bother? So much hassle with planning, having a budget and all that. I'm making a lot of money, so why bother anyways.}

After all, I really was making good money.

But whatever I made never stuck with me for long. Trip to Asia, bespoke suit\dots and my bank account empty again. Then I noticed that my grandfather was right.
